# Assembly
This repository is for me to store my files whiel I learn Assembly as well as serve as a reference for when I need to double check something. I've left comments to help me understand my own code, but it won't be enough to teach Assembly from scratch.

# Strcture
Each folder contains a 1-2 example files that demonstrate a concept/feature of Assembly. There will also usually be simple exercises in each folder that I used to practice

# Library
A folder of functions that will be reused many times. I'm putting them there as a reference and to copy from whenever I need to use a function

# Leetcode
As a challenge, I have started attempting some Leetcode problems in Assembly. To make things easier for myself, I have changed the problem structure so that all inputs come from stdin and are output to stdout.
